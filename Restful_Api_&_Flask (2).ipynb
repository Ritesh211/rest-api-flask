        "1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        ">> A RESTful API follows REST (Representational State Transfer) principles and allows communication between client and server using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of API specification.\n",
        ">> An API specification defines how an API behaves — including endpoints, methods, request/response formats — ensuring consistency and ease of integration.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        ">> Flask is a lightweight Python web framework. It's popular for APIs due to its simplicity, flexibility, minimal setup, and large extension ecosystem.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        ">> Routing in Flask maps URLs to specific functions in your code using the @app.route() decorator, determining how an application responds to client requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "app.run()\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        ">> Common methods include GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (remove), and PATCH (partial update).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        ">> It defines URL routes and binds them to view functions to handle requests at that route.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> GET: Requests data (no body); used for reading.\n",
        "\n",
        "POST: Sends data to the server (in body); used for creating resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        ">> Use error handlers with @app.errorhandler() to catch and respond to errors (e.g., 404, 500) with custom messages or JSON responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        ">> Use Flask extensions like Flask-SQLAlchemy to configure and manage the connection using connection strings and models.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        ">> It simplifies working with SQL databases by integrating SQLAlchemy ORM with Flask, allowing easier model definition and query execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        ">> Blueprints let you organize your app into modular components (e.g., for different routes or features), improving structure and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        ">> It provides access to incoming request data such as form inputs, JSON payloads, headers, and query parameters.\n",

        "14. How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "16. Explain Flask’s url_for() function.\n",
        ">> url_for() generates URLs for functions dynamically, making code cleaner and avoiding hardcoded paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n",
        ">> By default, Flask serves static files from the /static folder. You can access them using /static/filename.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n",
        ">> An API specification (like OpenAPI) defines the structure and behavior of an API, improving documentation, testing, and collaboration.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        ">> They indicate the result of an HTTP request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found). They help clients understand the response status.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> @app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])\n",

        "22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n",

        "\n",
        "23. What is the role of Flask’s session object?\n",
        ">> It stores user-specific data (like login status) across requests using secure cookies.\n",
